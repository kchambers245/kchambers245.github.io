###Mnmly is  website for designer Hiroaki Yamane. I really like it because it's really different from almost any other website I've seen. I really like that the font is huge and scrolls and fades off the screen. I also like the addition of the animation to the links. The only problem I has was that the links did not work at times. If I refreshed the page they would begin working again, though. So I'm not sure what would cause them to malfunction?
