## January 25, 2014 - My favorite internet thing.

[REI 1440 Project](http://www.rei1440project.com/)

###An awesome website I came across this past week was the REI 1440 Project--"a celebration of every minute spent outside."

###REI created a website featuring a visual timeline populated by user submitted photos taken outside at a specific time. I found it interesting because of how intimate the website felt--making you feel like you're actually viewing these snippets of people's lives as they are happening.

###I also like nature photos.
