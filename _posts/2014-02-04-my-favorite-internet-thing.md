[C-ROOTS](http://www.c-roots.com/)

### This week I found the website for the design studio C-Roots. Their website featured a really dynamic navigation system that manipulated itself and appears to hover every time it is clicked. It's a tough navigation to use functionally-wise, but I think it could be interesting if used appropriately.

### I feel C-Roots in general uses it well, but it becomes a bit awkward in that you have to slide back to home anytime you want a new result.
