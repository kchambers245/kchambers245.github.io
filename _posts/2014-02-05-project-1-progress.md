##February 5, 2014 - Project 1 Process

### This past week I have been exploring different ideas for the library website's look. I first began by trying to figure out a look for the library's website, though after a couple sketches I decided to shift to work on a page such as the media viewing page, which a past teacher had encouraged doing because pages such as those usually need to hold the most informationâ€”and thus are most restricted in terms of design. Though if you successfully manage to design these pages, you should be able to extend your design to fit the other pages relatively easily.
