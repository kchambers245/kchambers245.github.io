## February 11, 2014 - Project 1 Process

### This week I looked more in-depth into bootstrap than I had previously done before. I also tried to incorporate the use of SASS into my project, which we learned the basics of in our previous class. I continued to find it a bit confusing, but am confident with more practice I will better learn how to make my way around it. For now I just fumbled my way through to get what I wanted, which isnâ€™t too horrible, I guess. I still learn a lot that way.
