[Photomap](http://www.photomap.chris-wang.com)

###Photomap is a website by designer Chris Wang to showcase his amateur photography.

### I really enjoy the simplicity of the main page and the additions of the animation and pop of color on the rollovers. The pages with photos I find loads a bit slowly, but once working, the website displays the photos nicely. 

###It's not a website for someone who is in for a quick glance--it forces the viewr to theke time and look at each of the images before moving to the next.
