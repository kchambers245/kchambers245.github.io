March, 5 2014 - Project 1 Progress

![](/img/proj1.png)

[Project 1](http://kchambers245.github.io/project-01/index.html)

Here is my "finished" website for project one! (I only say this because I hope to revisit it in the future.) It took a lot of time, a lot of troubleshooting, and a lot of learning to finish this. My big problem that I have not quite solved is trying to get elements from Bootstrap to function and style the way I would like them to. Everything else I more-or-less got to function as planned.

Overall, I'm pretty happy with how it turned out.
