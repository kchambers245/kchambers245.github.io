[Project 1](http://kchambers245.github.io/project-01/index.html)

Here is my finished website for project one! It took a lot of time, a lot of troubleshooting, and a lot of learning to finish this. I hope to visit it again some day when I know a bit more to make things more efficient and work more as I originally invisioned.

Overall, I'm pretty happy with how it turned out, though.
