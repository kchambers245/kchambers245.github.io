## March 11, 2014 - Project 2 Process

### This past week I've been looking into APIs and how I can use them in my own website. I am pretty much decided that I want to make a music gig and venue site, which would allow users to look up their location and find any music events going on around them (through the use of Facebook).

### For a while I was considering making a website with a similar idea to the REI project, where it would look up Instagram tags that deal with camping, an them map them on a map of where they are. My problem with this idea was that most Instagram users don't use the location mapping option given to them, so I would have no way to know where to map the information. I also was concerned about making another website that had no real function other than aesthetics--I really want to create something that could potentially be useful if fully functional.
