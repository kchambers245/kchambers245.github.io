[How Far is it to Mars?](http://www.distancetomars.com/)

### I'm really intrigued by the amount of websites that include animation-like elements that are triggered by scrolls and other regular page navigation. I also like the story-telling aspect. This one is interesting because you feel like you're stuck in the scroll until other elements appear to let you know that it is purposeful.

### Overall it's entertaining, though.
