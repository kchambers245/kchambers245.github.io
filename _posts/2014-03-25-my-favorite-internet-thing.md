##March 25, 2014 - My favorite internet thing.

[Evoke](http://cafeevoke.com/)

###This week I came across a webite for Evoke, a cafe located in Oklahoma. Unlike the past websites I have posted about, there are very few facy things going on this page (other than the rotating text with the slideshow).

###I'm drawn to this website because it's so different from a lot of what's popular in web design right now. There are so many wesites full of javascript at the moment (especially parallax scrolls), making the once innovative and interesting designs and techniques seem almost like a cop-out. This website looks like the deisgner took a poster and made it into a website, which I thought was awesome.
