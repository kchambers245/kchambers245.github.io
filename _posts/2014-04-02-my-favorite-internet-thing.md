[Names for Change](http://wwww.namesforchange.org)

###Names for Change is an organization that gives people the opportunity to name ever-day items for a price, and recieve a custom poster. The money raised will be used to provide those who need it with food and shelter. 

###The website itself I find beautiful and features a function and aethetically pleasing sorking mechanism to display the items. The trasitions on the links I also find to work nicely.
