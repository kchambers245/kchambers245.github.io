[The Future of Football](http://www.oregongridiron.com)

###This website in an incredibly ornate wesbite created for the football team of the University of Oregon (which I assume to be named Grid Iron from the website name, though I couldn't find that basic information on the website itself...). In my opinion, it's a bit too much. There is a lot going on, and at least 3 ways to get almost anywhere. The thing I did find cool was the set of videos that play as a textural element in the background of each of the main pages. I think it is elegant in way that is very interesting.
