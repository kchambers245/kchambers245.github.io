##April 15, 2014 - Project 2 Progress

[Project 2](http://kchambers245.github.io/project-02/)

###Here is my, again "finished" website for project two, where I worked with APIs to create a website that would allow for one to search a location and find a map of all the music events happening around him or her.

###Overall, this project was a struggle. I continued to have a difficult time using javascript (in addition to bootstrap add-ons giving me a hard time), although I hope with practice I will be able to become better. I think my biggest problem was not understanding the language and how to troubleshoot. With html and CSS, I undertand its "language" enough to see where things could be going wrong and what different methods I could try to get it to do what I want. If that doesn't work out, I at least know the terminology to look it up and fiddle with that. I'm not that confident with Javascript yet, but hopefully that will come with working with it more.
