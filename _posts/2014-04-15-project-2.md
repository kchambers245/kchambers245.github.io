[Project 2](http://kchambers245.github.io/project-02/)

###Here is my finished website for project two, where I worked with APIs to create a website that would allow for one to search a location and find a map of all the music events happening around him or her.

###Overall, this project was a struggle. I continued to have a difficult time using javascript, although I hope with practice I will be able to become better.
