[A journey through Middle Earth](http://middle-earth.thehobbit.com/)

###This website is apparently a website created as an experiement by the team promoting The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug using Google Earth. The idea is that you can navigate Middle Earth and learn about the different areas you happen on. 

###While I find this a cool idea, I couldn't get it to function well when I just wanted to navigate around the map. If I clicked on any of the areas, it wouldn't do anything, and I would also become stuck in that position (and would have to refresh to start over). If I navigated using the navigation, everything seems to work, just a little slow and finicky. 

###It's neat though. It sort of seems like I'm playing a videogame.
