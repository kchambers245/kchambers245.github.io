[Passion Genome](http://www.nissanusa.com/passiongenome/)

###This is a project created by Nisson USA, where it looks at your Facebook information in creates a picture for you based on your "passions," (as decided by Facebook).

###It was pretty fun to look through, though I'm not quite sure how the data was chosen to create each protrait. It seemed a bit random, for example, or it would say things like "72% of your likes in Movie and TV are for a movie." What is that really even supposed to tell me? I don't know. It looks cool though.

###It looks like Nissan must be using a API to gather the data, but I don't know what they are using to create the image itself out of. It reminds me of work that I have seen created using Processing.
