## April 09, 2014 - My Favorite Internet Thing.

[Z-type](phoboslab.org/z-type)

###Z-type isn't really a website bit it is indeed a cool internet thing. 

###It's a game that you use your typing skills to school bullets at upcoming words and letters. I find it fun to pass the time with. The music chosen I find is the only thing that throws me off a bit. The movement on the screen is nice and smooth, so a soothing musis sort of makes sense, but this particuar music is somewhat haunting and very serious. It just changest the mood a lot.
