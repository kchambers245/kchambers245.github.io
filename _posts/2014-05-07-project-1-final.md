## May 7, 2014 - Project 2

####Creative brief:

###I was tasked to redesign the Pratt Enoch Library Website in such a way that would suit a more technologically inclined audience—individuals most likely in their late teens to 20s—who are interested in being able to access all the information they need without physically visiting the library.

###This redesign is necessary because the current library system is outdated and does not cater to the growing use technology that more easily enables people to read information online. 

###To get to this point, I interviewed several persons who I felt fit the criteria for those who intended to use the website. After receiving their input, I set out to research and explore websites that were already implementing some of the key features my interviewees wanted to see.

###Finally, I reviewed these websites as a whole to establish their successes and downfalls.
