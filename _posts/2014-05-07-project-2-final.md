## May 7, 2014 - Project 2

####Creative brief:

###I was tasked to design a website that would incorporate the use of APIs, or Application Programming Interfaces, in functionality of the site.

###After brainstorming a few ideas and looking at what options were available, I decided to create a website mapping out all the local music venues and what bands they are or will be playing. The idea would be for someone to be able to look up where he or she is, and quickly see if there are any bands they are interested in seeing playing around them.
